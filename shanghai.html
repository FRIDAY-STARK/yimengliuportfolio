  <div class="approach">Visual Metaphor Project<br>
   In Collaboration With Robin Xie and Shaoguang Yang</div>

<div class="description">
"Nightlife in Shanghai" is produced by me and Robin, featuring Shaoguang. This project aims to explore the contrast between the luxurious and extravagant nightlife of Shanghai and the inner feelings of its people. Through the story of an elegant lady who indulges in the city's vibrant nightlife but is trapped by both vanity and reality, we depict the struggles and sorrows of people in Shanghai. The lady represents the city's inhabitants, and the fancy nightlife serves as a temporary escape from their everyday lives, where they face various pressures and difficulties. The goldfish in a fishbowl symbolizes the lady's entrapment, where being trapped by vanity leads to wasting youth, and being trapped by reality means being unable to find true happiness even amidst the glamour of Shanghai's nightlife.<br><br>
Our inspiration for this project stems from our experiences as college students residing in Shanghai, where despite the bustling city life, the fast pace and pressure can sometimes lead to feelings of depression and entrapment.We also drew inspiration from the song "Can't Get Your Love" and its covers, which evokes a passion for old Shanghai. Similarly, the song "Nightlife in Shanghai" represents the style of the time period we aim to depict in our project. The 1930s, a time of industry, agriculture, business, and finance development, was also a period of war and oppression, creating a paradoxical setting that further inspires our project.<br><br>
We were trying to make the goldfish in the small fishbowl symbolize the female character featured in our project. We decided to use the chandelier and smoke as representations of the luxurious nightlife and her inner sorrow. In the scene where the woman looks at herself in the mirror, we wanted to create an illusion of vanity, as the reflections in the mirror are virtual images. This scene corresponds to the lyrics suggesting that "sinking into the absurdity of the nightlife wastes one's youth", as the character is trapped in a world that is not real.

<div class="description1">夜上海 夜上海 你是个不夜城<br> Shanghai nights, Shanghai nights, you are a city that never sleeps<br><br>

华灯起 车声响 歌舞升平<br> Bright lights, sounds of cars, singing and dancing<br><br>

只见她 笑脸迎 谁知她内心苦闷<br> Just seeing her smiling face, who knows of her inner sorrow?<br><br>

夜生活 都为了 衣食住行<br> Nightlife is all for daily life<br><br>

酒不醉人人自醉<br> Drinks aren’t intoxicating to people; it’s the nightlife itself.<br><br>

胡天胡地蹉跎了青春<br> Sinking into absurdity wastes youth.<br><br>

晓色朦胧 倦眼惺忪 大家归去<br> In the dawn light, tired people started to get back home<br><br>

心灵儿随着转动的车轮<br> With their souls that return along the running wheels<br><br>

换一换 新天地 别有一个新环境<br> She engages in a new world,  a new environment in daytime<br><br>

回味着 夜生活 如梦初醒<br> Reminiscing her nightlife, like waking from a dream in the sunrise<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
