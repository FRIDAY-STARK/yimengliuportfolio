  <div class="approach">Sound Design for Re-edited Clip from The Film, La Jetee<br>
  Synthesized & Composed in REAPER.</div>

  <div class="description">
	In this sound design project, I re-edited the film, La Jetee and changed its storyline based on my own understanding. Instead of having a voiceover, I focused on building up tensions and conveying abstract feelings and concepts generated according to the still images.</div>

	 <div class="description">
	The story starts with scenes on a deck. Spatialization and temporalization are incorporated. An environment of airport is constructed by bell tones, announcement, ambience, sounds of airplane and rolling suitcase movers, and footsteps. A young woman first comes into the frame. Everything looks peaceful, like a beautiful memory at sunset, so I used synthesizer to create some harmonious tones, which are also non-diegetic sounds. The beginning and the end of the video clip are closely related, so I decided to create sounds based on the end of the video and apply them in the first part to extend the scope of those still images. I used some running sounds. I distorted a real recording sound of a rifle gunshot and a foley of a dropping bullet; they suddenly appeared so I didn’t design any sounds for the crowd in order to fully exploit the advantage of the stillness, emphasizing people’s silence caused by getting shocked. The bullet drop sound comes a little later than it has to in the real world on purpose. It is not only served as something realistic but also represents the falling body of the victim who gets shot.<br><br>I synthesized sound effects for the second part, which is obviously consist of war and ruins
scenes. I created mega bass for transitioning in darkness and it helps build up tensions of the war.
This percussion synthesizer also makes me feel like war drums, and I really recommend listening
through earphones or headphones to avoid missing details. I created notes in the synthesizer, Vital, in
which the variation intensely conveys the burst, the seriousness, and worsening situation of the war
followed by depressing and despairing synthetic sounds. The synthesis is consecutive and pretty
conceptual.<br><br>
After that, the third part is shown in a narrower space. In the original film, the man is supposed to
have a time travel under the mad scientists’ commands through hypnosis. However, due to the lack of
voiceover, I decided to let the audiences imagine based on both my sound design and the media

itself. I began with a talking toy singing a lullaby. This part sounds the most creepy and conceptual,
adding feeling of absurdity and mystery to the piece. I used materials I collected and variations I
made from my own audio library. I was inspired by the chorale’s show I attended in my freshman
year in the Go Local program at NYU Shanghai. We had a song named Africa, which included
percussion and vocal scat. Before the show started, the professor asked the whole crew to rub our
hands and some of us to snap our fingers. The sounds we created were mimicking rain drops in
African rain forests. In addition to hand rubbing and finger snaps, I added sound of air bubble
popping in a can of coke to make it smoother and to fit the hypnosis scene in which the man looks
like falling asleep with a pair of eye patches over his face. The raining sound emphasizes loneliness
and leaves room for audiences’ imagination. The sound design for the man’s suffering scenes
includes sounds of turning on the stovetop, nails sliding on the surface of a feather chair, flipping a
coin, distorted human voices (I hummed the tone of “woo”), etc., after which I highlighted the man’s
rhythmic heartbeat and breath, implying that he becomes rested after suffering.<br><br>
I didn’t make the ending part realistic. Instead, I took an experimental move. Giving up foleys and
ambience, I distorted a piece of conversation in which two French women were whispering to each
other. I added reverbs, delays, and equalizations, and I slowed down its playback rate, so that it
would sound more mysterious and terrifying, indicating that these scenes were not real or not
happening in the present. The heartbeats get faster as images go on to work with the “motion” of the
man. And in the end, the man meets the young woman from the beginning of the video at the end of
the deck, and he gets shot. He dies in front of the woman, therefore resonating with the start of the
film. As he falls to the ground, all sounds are shut off but the same foley of bullet drop appears. In
the very end, as the scene fades out, the sound of talking toy rises again from the silence, and I added
a cue after the doll says "ready?". It is an inhaling sound, building an open ending for patient
audiences who listen through the last second.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></div>
