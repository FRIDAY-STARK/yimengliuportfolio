*Access Granted*
Hello, Agent Jellyfish. This is Devon, your supervisor.
Congrats! You have passed the little test I gave you.
From now on, you have officially been a member of The Lost Cape.
Your cover identity is going to be a bartender... Trust me, there will be a lot of fun.
Now get on your Ink-Jet. I am waiting for you back at the headquarter.
See you very soon. Long live to the ocean.
