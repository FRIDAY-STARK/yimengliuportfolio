*pick up*
... 
... Hello, hello. Agent Jellyfish?
Thank god, we finally fix the cables and get in touch with you.
Your supervisor, Devon the "Siren", is busy right now. 
You might have to complete your first mission on your own.
Take it easy, Agent Jellyfish. It is just a simple mission.
First, get out of this safe house. 
An Ink-Jet, of course the newest version designed by Dr.Octopus, has landed outside.
Get on the Ink-Jet. It will take you to the destination automatically. 
Thanks to Dr.Octopus one more time.
We will give you more instructions after you arrive.
Good luck. Long live to the ocean.
