... Hello, hello. Agent Jellyfish?
Thank god, we finally fix the cables and get in touch with you.
Your supervisor, Devon the "Siren", is busy right now. 
You might have to complete your first mission on your own.
Take it easy, Agent Jellyfish. It is just a simple mission.
First, get out of this safe house. 
An Ink-Jet, of course the newest version designed by Dr.Octopus, has landed outside.
Get on the Ink-Jet. It will take you to the destination automatically. 
Thanks to Dr.Octopus one more time.
We will give you more instructions after you arrive.
Good luck. Long live to the ocean.

"...Sirens feed on human's greed and evil. 
Each of them is gifted with different powers by Neptune. 
In some Sirens' eyes, longings are visualized in terms of colors. 
When they see YELLOW comes out of someone, 
...no one can stop their illusive voices from luring the preys."

"...Sirens are able to turn their tails into a pair of legs, and vice versa. 
A drunk pirate claimed he once saw that the singer at The Lost Cape, 
a bar on the seashore, turned their legs 
into a beautiful PINK tail under the moonlight. "

"...a witch-hunter saved a young Siren from a group of crazy wizards three hundred years ago. 
(For now, we have no idea if it was a male or female Siren. 
Therefore, we shall use they/them as prounouns in the following passages.) 
She named the young Siren Devon. 
The witch-hunter found the wizards' grimoire, 
in which Siren's wings were mentioned as an ingredient of a certain kind of potions. 
We don't have any evidence to prove that Sirens have wings 
but the witch-hunter's diary but I couldn't help thinking about it.
Were they covered by WHITE feathers... like angels...?"
*pick up the diary*
"...I saved Devon a few days ago. 
The wizards were torturing them when I found where the coven was. 
Devon left me a deep impression. 
Their tail look like made from Rose Quartz, but softer. 
They have lots of scars and wounds on their back, some of which are still bleeding. 
I am surprised that Devon's blood is BLUE."
*Access Granted*
Hello, Agent Jellyfish. This is Devon, your supervisor.
Congrats! You have passed the little test I gave you.
From now on, you have officially been a member of The Lost Cape.
Your cover identity is going to be a bartender... Trust me, there will be a lot of fun.
Now get on your Ink-Jet. I am waiting for you back at the headquarter.
See you very soon. Long live to the ocean.
