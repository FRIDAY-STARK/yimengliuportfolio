"...a witch-hunter saved a young Siren from a group of crazy wizards three hundred years ago. 
(For now, we have no idea if it was a male or female Siren. 
Therefore, we shall use they/them as prounouns in the following passages.) 
She named the young Siren Devon. 
The witch-hunter found the wizards' grimoire, 
in which Siren's wings were mentioned as an ingredient of a certain kind of potions. 
We don't have any evidence to prove that Sirens have wings 
but the witch-hunter's diary but I couldn't help thinking about it.
Were they covered by WHITE feathers... like angels...?"
