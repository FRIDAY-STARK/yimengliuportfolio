*pick up the diary and read it*
"...I saved Devon a few days ago. 
The wizards were torturing them when I found where the coven was. 
Devon left me a deep impression. 
Their tail look like made from Rose Quartz, but softer. 
They have lots of scars and wounds on their back, some of which are still bleeding. 
I am surprised that Siren's blood is BLUE."
