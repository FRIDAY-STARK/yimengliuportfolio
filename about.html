		<div class="what-is">Hi, I'm Yimeng 'Devon' Liu.</div>
		<div class="devon">I define myself as a multimedia designer and a daydreamer. I have always been drawn to the world of design and storytelling. Born and raised in China, and based in Brooklyn, New York, I am now studying in the B.S+M.S program in Integrated Design & Media at New York University, with a minor of Management. <br><br>
			The opportunity of studying both design and business has given me a unique perspective on the intersection of creativity and strategy. My works ranges from still and moving images to user experience, graphic design, and sound design. In 2021, I worked as the publicity manager, photographer, and assistant director for a student musical production, Waving Production, of Dear Evan Hansen in Shanghai, China. I have been directing and helping to organize club events in Brooklyn, New York, for NYU Tandon Chinese Scholar and Student Association since 2022.<br><br>

			I sometimes feel like being in another universe. I am facinated by east asian cultural heritage. I love fictions, animes, and RPGs. Game development, interactive narrative, and character design are also my interests. I used to be a dancer and have Chinese classic dance experience of over ten years. If there were afterlife, I wish I could be a butterfly.<br><br>
