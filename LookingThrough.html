  CRYSTAL BALLS CONTAINING DREAMS</div>

<div class="description">
  "Looking Through" is a project I created by the end of my first year in New York, when Christmas is coming. In China, we donâ€™t officially celebrate Chirstmas. Instead, we celebrate the Spring Festival, which is on the first day of Chinese lunar new year. We usually have holiday markets called Miao Hui in Chinese, meaning temple fairs. Though I had been to Christmas markets when I was in Shanghai, it was a different experience in New York. In "Looking Through", I focus on elements of Christmas in New York, including but not limited to holiday markets, window displays, christmas trees, etc. <br><br>
  The collection of photos depicts a weird dream of X-mas and has an engaging range from slightly abstract to purely abstract. I used a fisheye lens for shooting, exploiting the limited view and distortion caused by fisheye lens to create an illusional visual effect mimicking how people see through the glass of crystal balls.  At the same time, I want to explore how photographs can differentiate from what we see by our own eyes in the real world. <br><br>
  Looking through the fisheye lens, I add a cooler tone to the photos, which seems opposite to happiness represented by Christmas. The reason behind such choice is that I regard myself as a stranger in the holiday. Due to cultural difference, I don't have a special feeling or attachment to Christmas, and the happiness seems quite distant to me who is far away from home and family.<br><br><br><br>
